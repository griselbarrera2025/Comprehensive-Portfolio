        "It can't just read text the way we do. It doesnt understand the way we do. Text is letters and characters, and computers only deal with numbers.

        "We lose the order of the words (BoW) model, and how they relate to each other. It's like dumping all the words in one bag and just counting how many times each word shows up, not paying attention to where they we're in the sentence.

        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "The high sparcity in our (BoW) model shows that most of our values in our document is just zeros. That means for each sentence or document, only a few words from the whole vocabularyare actually used. The rest of them are just taking up space with zeros. So it's not very efficient, especially when the vocabulary gets huge. We're wasting a lot of memory and processing power on words that are not even there.\n",

        "Even though (BoW) has its flaws, like losing word order and being super sparse, it can still be useful in certain situations-especially if the text is short, the vocabulary is small, or you don't need deep meaning. Like for spam detection, BoW can work great because certain words like \"free\", \"winner\", or \"click\" show up alot in spam emails. Its fast and doesn't need alot of computing power, so it's good when working with limited resources."

        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "It asks a smart question, for example: Is this word really imporatnt, or does it just show up everywhere? Imagine you have 100 documents, and: \"car\" appears in 1 document but \"the\" appears in all 100. In this scenario, TF-IDF lowers it's weight because it is in everything. But \"car\" appears once in 1 doc? It gets high score- because its specific and rare. It's way smarter. It tells you what is imprortant.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 2:** What advantages do bigrams and trigrams provide over unigrams? Give specific examples from the n-gram analysis above.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "Unigram is 1 word at a time, Bigram is 2-word pairs, and tri gram is 3 word combos. Unigrams lose meaning. If I say: \"heat\" and \"map\" - are we talking about fire or gps? But if I use bigram: \"heatmap\" --> now it's clear.  Unigrams are pieces. Bigrams and trigrams give you the sentences flavor.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 3:** Looking at the similarity matrices, which method (BOW or TF-IDF) seems to provide more meaningful similarity scores? Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "TF-IDF gives more meaningful similarity scores than BoW. BoW just counts words. It treats every word equally. Two documents might look similar in BoW just because they both say \"the car is fast\", even if one is about cars and the other is about bikes. BoW is higher in score versus TF-IDF is lower. BoW is basic and surface level. TF-IDF is deeper - and looks at what really defines the document.\n",

        "Higher-order n-grams (like trigrams or 4-grams) give more context than unigrams, but they come with trade offs. They dramatically increase the size of your feature space, making models slower and more memory-hungry. They also lead to very sparse data and can cause over fitting by capturing overly specific phrases. While they can be useful for short texts or phrase level analysis, they're less efficient for large scale tasks without smart filtering or dimensionality reduction."

        "**Question 1:** Explain the distributional hypothesis in your own words. Why is it important for word embeddings?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "The distributional hypothesis says that words appearing in similar contexts tend to have smaller meanings. This idea is the foundation for word embeddings, which turn words into vectors based on how they're used in text. It helps models understand that words like \"king\" and \"queen\" are related, even if they're not directly defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 2:** Why does \"king - man + woman ≈ queen\" work in word embeddings? What does this tell us about the vector space?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "The model captures the relationship between words as direction in space. It's not just storing meanings - it's learning how words relate to each other. This tells us vector has structure, where semantic relationships become math - so changing \"man\" to \"woman\" shifts \"king\" in the same direction that leads to \"queen\".\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 3:** Based on the comparison table, when would you choose sparse representations over dense embeddings?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "You'd choose sparse representations (like Bag of Words or TF-IDF) when your data is small, you want simple models, or you need speed and transparency- like in basic text classification or quick filters. They're easier to understand and faster to compute, especially when deep meaning isn't nessesary. But if you are dealing with large datasets, complex language patterns, or want deeper context (like for chatbots or semantic search) then dense embeddings are the way to go.  So it's a trade off: sparce is simple and light, dense is smart and powerful.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 4:** What are the potential ethical concerns with word embeddings? (Hint: think about bias in training data)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "Word embeddings can pick up bias from the training data, because they learn from real world text - which often include stereotypes, racism, sexism, and other harmful patterns. For example, an embedding might associate \"man\" with \"doctor\" and \"woman\" with \"nurse\" just because that's what it saw in the data. This can lead to biased predictions in AI systems, like unfair hiring tools or toxic chat bots. So the concern is if the data's biased, the model will be too. That can mess up real peoples lives."

        "**Question 1:** Based on your classification results, which text representation method performed best? Why do you think this is the case?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "BoW performed decently but struggled with context, TF-IDF performmed better by down wieghing common words and highlighting more meaningful terms and word embeddings performed the best because it captures the meaning and realtionship between words.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 2:** Describe a real-world application where you would use each of the following:\n",
        "- BOW representation:\n",
        "- TF-IDF representation:\n",
        "- Word embeddings:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "BoW- Used for quick spam email detection, TF-IDF is great for document search engines to rank results by highlighting important, unique words in each document, and word embeddings are perfect for chat bots that need to understand the meaning behind user messages and respod naturally.  \n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 3:** What ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a text classification system in a real-world application (e.g., resume screening, content moderation)?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "When deploying a tax classification system, you have to watch for bias in the training data that could unfairly descriminate against certain groups. Make sure the system is transparent and explainable, so decisions can be understood and challenged. Protect users privacy by handlong sensitive data carefully and securely. Always handle human over sight to catch mistakes and avoid unfair automated judgements.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 4:** How has your understanding of text representation evolved over these 5 parts? What was the most surprising thing you learned?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "My understanding grew from simple word counts to seeing how context and meaning matter with embeddings; the most suprising part was how math in vector spaace can capture complex word relationships like \"king-man + woman = queen.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Question 5:** If you were to continue learning about text representation, what topics would you want to explore next?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your Answer:**\n",
        "I would like to explore transformers, attantion mechanisms and how large language models undertsand and generate text. They're the cutting edge tech powering today's smartest AI language tools."
